                            designs, functional pieces and clothing styles, but where did it come from and how did it
                            grow into the world's largest
                            footwear company?

                <h2 class="title title-about">How did Nike get its name?</h2>
                <div class="row">

                    <div class="col-2">
                        <p class="paragraph p2">Nike, one of the world's most recognizable brands, derived its name from
                            Greek mythology. The company's co-founders,
                            Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight, were inspired by the Greek goddess of victory, Nike
                            (pronounced "ny-kee" or "nee-kay").
                            The name Nike symbolizes strength, speed, and triumph, which aligns with the brand's focus
                            on athletic footwear and
                            apparel.
                            <br>
                            Since its inception, Nike has become synonymous with athletic excellence and has grown into
                            a global leader in the
                            sports industry, offering a wide range of products for athletes of all levels. The iconic
                            Nike logo, known as the
                            "Swoosh," also embodies the brand's dynamic and energetic spirit.

                        <p class="paragraph p3">A few years later in 1984, Nike signed a 21-year-old upcoming basketball
                            player by the name of Michael Jordan. Despite
                            being a rookie in the NBA, Jordan dismissed the possibility of signing with direct
                            competitors Reebok or Converse and
                            decided instead to sign for Nike for the fee of $500,000 a year.
                            <br>
                            The signing was spurred on by the promise that Nike would give MJ his own signature line and
                            so, Air Jordan was born.
                            Proceeding the signing, Jordan would play a few games in the Nike Air Ship sneaker, but that
                            would eventually be banned
                            due to the colourway not adhering to NBA standards of the time. Instead, Nike designers
                            Peter Moore, Tinker Hatfield,
                            and Bruce Kilgore all decided to focus their energy elsewhere and Air Jordan 1 was born.
                            <br>
                            The original Air Jordan 1 sneakers were designed exclusively for Michael Jordan in late 1984
                            and would eventually go on
                            general sale in April of 1985. The shoe itself featured a high-top construction, the famous
                            Nike Swoosh and a black/red
                            "Bred" colourway.
                            <br>
                            In 1987, Nike launched a new range of sneakers starting with the Air Max 1. These sneakers
                            were designed primarily by
                            Tinker Hatfield and featured the first physical encapsulation of air within their cushioned
                            midsoles. The original
                            colourway arrived in a University Red/White colourway, and to this day is a silhouette
                            desired by sneakerheads around
                            the world even today.
                            <br>
                            In 1990, Nike moved into its eight-building world headquarters campus in Beaverton Oregon.
                            The sprawling 400 acre land
                            of the Beaverton HQ allowed access for 11,000 employees as well as Nike Sports Research lab
                            for developing all the
                            latest technology, a Nike Museum to showcase relics of the past, three fitness centres and
                            facilities for sponsored
                            athletes, and a range of sports fields, tracks and running paths.
                            <br>
                            Alongside this, the third Nike Air Max arrived in the form of the Nike Air Max 90. This
                            particular model featured a
                            chunkier construction as well as a more futuristic design and style.
